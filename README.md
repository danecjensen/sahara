# MongoDB example app

- It connects to a database, creates a collection, populates it with items, then drops the collection and closes the connection. Writes the steps to the page with Express.

- It uses [mLab](https://mlab.com) for a free hosted mongodb instance

- This is based on [nodeSimpleExample.js example](https://github.com/mongolab/mongodb-driver-examples/blob/master/nodejs/nodeSimpleExample.js)
